        <p> You stare out at the barren wasteland that was Antarctica. When you signed up for the expedition, it had sounded like an adventure, going into uncharted areas and relying on nothing but your wits and survival instincts as well as those of your comrades beside you. In hindsight, it was a very stupid idea, and you wonder if you had been supremely drunk those few seconds you signed up. <\p>
        <p> But alas, regrets won't help you now. You are stuck in what adventurers would call a very tight situation. For one, the food supplies had run out several weeks ago. To make it worse, in your half-crazed hunger, you and your companions had consumed the dogs who were pulling your sled. The only option left is pulling the sled yourselves towards your destination, where a team of rescuers would be waiting to take you home. A hot shower and a warm meal sounds good about now. <\p>
        <p>However, the last dog was consumed over a week ago. Hungry, tired, and cold, you might just die here. <\p>
        <p>You look over at your companions. They look as terrible as you feel. Some worse. <\p>
        <p>What would you like to do in your last moments? <\p>

        <p> You try talking to them, but they are so hungry and tired they could only respond to you with slight nods. <\p>

let TEXT_INTRO_STARING = 
    `
        <p> You try to see as far as possible, hoping to find a glimpse, any glimpse of civilization. No such luck. <\p>

let TEXT_INTRO_THINKING = 
    `
        <p> You wish you could think. But it seems that hunger has killed off most of your brain cells. Not that you've got much to begin with going on this expedition in the first place. <\p>

        <p> Things are getting really bad. You're getting hungrier. What do you do now? <\p>

        <p> You're so hungry you could eat a polar bear. If only polar bears can be found in Antarctica. You glance at your companions again. Some are as pale as polar bears. You absentmindedly wonder if they would taste like polar bears, too. <\p>
        <p> You shake your head to clear that thought. You haven't lost your humanity. But you are hungry though. <\p>
        <p> What do you do now? <\p>
    `;

let TEXT_INTRO_4 = 
    `
        <p> You glance at your companions again. You lick your lips. You've heard that humans taste like chicken. You can already taste the chicken flavor. There's nothing for it... <\p>

let TEXT_BEGIN = 
    `
        <p> Now that the hunger, yours and your remaining companions', has been staved, you are ready to continue onto your destination. <\p>
